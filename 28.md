Let $w \in S$. Then $|w|_a = |w|_b$, so:

$$
|w|_a - |w|_b = 0
$$

Since $0 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ for every prime $p$, we have $w \in L_p$ for every prime $p$. 

Therefore:
$$
w \in \bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p
$$

### 2. Reverse Inclusion ($\bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p \subseteq S$)

Let $w \in \bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p$. Define $d = |w|_a - |w|_b$.

Since $w \in L_p$ for every prime $p$, we have:

$$
d \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \quad \text{for every prime } p
$$

This implies that every prime divides $d$.

**Claim:** $d = 0$.

Suppose for contradiction that $d \neq 0$. Then $|d| \ge 1$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $|d|$ has a prime factorization:

$$
|d| = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

where each $p_i$ is prime and each $a_i > 0$.

Since there are infinitely many primes, there exists a prime $q \notin \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\}$. Then $q \nmid d$, contradicting the fact that *every* prime divides $d$.

Therefore $d = 0$, and hence:

$$
|w|_a = |w|_b
$$

So $w \in S$.
