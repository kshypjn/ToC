Model Definition
Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a finite-state automaton augmented with a fixed-length array of size $k \in \mathbb{N}$, where:

- $Q$ is a finite set of control states
- $\Sigma$ is a finite input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ is a finite array cell alphabet
- $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \times \Gamma^k \to Q \times \Gamma^k$ is the transition function
- $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state
- $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states
- The array $A \in \Gamma^k$ has length $k$ fixed as a constant independent of input length

---

Proof: A configuration of $M$ is a pair $(q, A)$ where:
- $q \in Q$ — the control state
- $A \in \Gamma^k$ — the full contents of the array

The set of all configurations is:
$$\mathcal{C} = Q \times \Gamma^k$$

Since $Q$, $\Gamma$, and $k$ are all finite, we have:
$$|\mathcal{C}| = |Q| \cdot |\Gamma|^k < \infty$$

Construction of an Equivalent DFA

We now construct a standard DFA $M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ with no array that accepts exactly $L(M)$.


$$Q' = Q \times \Gamma^k$$

Each state of $M'$ encodes both the control state and the entire array contents. Since both components are finite, $|Q'| = |Q| \cdot |\Gamma|^k < \infty$.

Initial State

$$q_0' = (q_0,\ A_0)$$

where $A_0 \in \Gamma^k$ is the initial array contents (e.g., all cells initialized to a blank symbol).

Transition Function

For each $(q, A) \in Q'$ and each $\sigma \in \Sigma$, define:

$$\delta'\big((q, A),\ \sigma\big) = (q',\ A')$$

where $(q', A') = \delta(q,\ \sigma,\ A)$.

This is well-defined since $\delta$ is a total function on $Q \times \Sigma \times \Gamma^k$.

Accepting States

$$F' = \{(q, A) \in Q' \mid q \in F\}$$
