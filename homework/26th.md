Let N = (Q, {a}, δ, q₀, F) be a unary NFA where:
- Q = {q₀, q₁, ..., qₙ₋₁} with |Q| = n
- Σ = {a} (unary alphabet)
- δ: Q × {a} → 2^Q (transition function)
- q₀ ∈ Q (start state)
- F ⊆ Q (accept states)

On input aᵐ, the NFA starts in state q₀ and makes exactly m transitions on symbol a.

A computation path on aᵐ is a sequence of states:
```
q₀ → q₁ → q₂ → ... → qᵐ
```
where qᵢ₊₁ ∈ δ(qᵢ, a) for each i.

The NFA accepts aᵐ if and only if there exists at least one computation path ending in an accept state (qᵐ ∈ F).

Pigeonhole:

Consider any computation path of length m ≥ n:
```
q₀ → s₁ → s₂ → ... → sₘ
```

Since there are only n states and the path has m+1 states (including q₀), when m ≥ n by the Pigeonhole Principle, some state must repeat.

In a unary NFA, from any state q, reading symbol a always leads to the same set of possible next states δ(q, a). This is deterministic in terms of the structure, though multiple states may be reachable.

Reachability Sets

Define the reachability set after reading exactly k symbols:
```
Rₖ = {q ∈ Q | there exists a computation path: q₀ →^(aᵏ) q}
```

Since there are only 2ⁿ possible subsets of Q (possible reachability sets) and we have an infinite sequence R₀, R₁, R₂, R₃, ..., by the Pigeonhole Principle:

**There exist indices i < j ≤ 2ⁿ such that Rᵢ = Rⱼ**

Let:
- **n₀ = i** (threshold)
- **p = j - i** (period)

Claim: Reachability is Periodic
Claim:For all k ≥ 0, we have Rₙ₀₊ₖ = Rₙ₀₊ₖ₊ₚ

**Proof by induction on k:**

Base case (k=0): Rₙ₀ = Rᵢ = Rⱼ = Rₙ₀₊ₚ ✓

Inductive step: Assume Rₙ₀₊ₖ = Rₙ₀₊ₖ₊ₚ

Then:
```
Rₙ₀₊ₖ₊₁ = ⋃_{q ∈ Rₙ₀₊ₖ} δ(q, a)
        = ⋃_{q ∈ Rₙ₀₊ₖ₊ₚ} δ(q, a)    [by inductive hypothesis]
        = Rₙ₀₊ₖ₊ₚ₊₁
```

Therefore, the reachability sets become periodic with period p after position n₀.


The NFA accepts aᵐ if and only if Rₘ ∩ F ≠ ∅ (some reachable state is accepting).

Since Rₘ is ultimately periodic (Rₙ₀₊ₖ = Rₙ₀₊ₖ₊ₚ for all k ≥ 0), we have:

**For all m ≥ n₀:**
```
aᵐ ∈ L(N)  ⟺  Rₘ ∩ F ≠ ∅
           ⟺  Rₘ₊ₚ ∩ F ≠ ∅    [since Rₘ = Rₘ₊ₚ for m ≥ n₀]
           ⟺  aᵐ⁺ᵖ ∈ L(N)
```

Therefore, **L(N) is ultimately periodic with threshold n₀ ≤ 2ⁿ and period p ≤ 2ⁿ**.
