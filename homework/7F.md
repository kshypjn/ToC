Given $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k > 0$, consider the language $L_k$ consisting of all strings that represent the binary encoding of numbers divisible by $k$:

$$L_k = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* : \text{val}(w) \equiv 0 \pmod{k}\}$$

where $\text{val}(w)$ denotes the numerical value of the binary string $w$.

## Proof

Using Myhill-Nerode theorem, the minimum number of states in any DFA recognizing a language $L$ equals the number of equivalence classes of the indistinguishability relation $\equiv_L$.

Two strings $x, y \in \Sigma^*$ are indistinguishable with respect to $L$ iff :

$$\forall z \in \Sigma^* : (xz \in L \iff yz \in L)$$

Consider the strings representing the binary encodings of the numbers $0, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1$. these strings are denoted as $s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{k-1}$ where:

$$\text{val}(s_i) = i \quad \text{for } i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, k-1\}$$

For simplicity, let:
- $s_0 = \varepsilon$ (the empty string, representing 0)
- $s_i = $ binary representation of $i$ for $i \geq 1$

now to show that for any $i, j \in \{0, 1, \ldots, k-1\}$ with $i \neq j$, we have $s_i \not\equiv_{L_k} s_j$.

Since $i \neq j$ and both $i, j \in \{0, 1, \ldots, k-1\}$, we have that $i$ and $j$ are distinct remainders modulo $k$.

we have to find a string $z$ such that exactly one of $s_i z$ and $s_j z$ is in $L_k$.

Consider $z = \varepsilon$ (the empty string). Then:
- $s_i z = s_i$ has value $\text{val}(s_i) = i$
- $s_j z = s_j$ has value $\text{val}(s_j) = j$

Now observe:
- $s_i \in L_k \iff i \equiv 0 \pmod{k}$
- $s_j \in L_k \iff j \equiv 0 \pmod{k}$

Case 1: If $i = 0$ and $j \neq 0$ (where $0 < j < k$):
- $s_0 = \varepsilon \in L_k$ (since $0 \equiv 0 \pmod{k}$)
- $s_j \notin L_k$ (since $0 < j < k$ implies $j \not\equiv 0 \pmod{k}$)

Therefore $s_0 \not\equiv_{L_k} s_j$.

Case 2: If $i \neq 0$ and $j \neq 0$ (where $0 < i, j < k$ and $i \neq j$):

Both $s_i$ and $s_j$ are not in $L_k$ when taken alone. We need a different distinguishing string.

Consider the string $z$ representing the binary encoding of the number $m = k - i$. When we append $z$ to $s_i$:

$$\text{val}(s_i z) = \text{val}(s_i) \cdot 2^{|z|} + \text{val}(z)$$

By the Myhill-Nerode theorem, the minimum number of states in any DFA recognizing $L_k$ is equal to the number of equivalence classes of $\equiv_{L_k}$, which is at least $k$.
