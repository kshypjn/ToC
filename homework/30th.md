**Case 1:** $p(n)$ is constant, say $p(n) = c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{N}$.

Then $L_p = \{a^c\}$, which is clearly regular (finite language).

**Case 2:** $p(n)$ is linear, say $p(n) = an + b$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a \neq 0$.

Since $p(n) \geq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we need $a > 0$ (otherwise $p(n) \to -\infty$).

Then:
$$L_p = \{a^{an+b} : n \in \mathbb{N}, an+b \geq 0\}$$

We can write:
$$L_p = \{a^b, a^{a+b}, a^{2a+b}, a^{3a+b}, \ldots\}$$

This is an arithmetic progression of exponents with:
* First term: the smallest non-negative value $an + b$
* Common difference: $a$

Construction of DFA:

constructing a DFA that recognizes exactly those strings $a^\ell$ where $\ell \equiv b \pmod{a}$ and $\ell \geq \min\{an + b : n \in \mathbb{N}, an + b \geq 0\}$.

The DFA has states $q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_{a-1}$ where:
* State $q_i$ represents that we have read a string of length $\ell$ where $\ell \equiv i \pmod{a}$
* Initial state: $q_0$
* Transition function: $\delta(q_i, a) = q_{(i+1) \bmod a}$
* Accepting states: determined by which remainders modulo $a$ appear in $\{p(n) : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$

Since $p(n) = an + b$, the accepting state is $q_{b \bmod a}$ (with appropriate handling for the minimum length requirement).

Therefore, $L_p$ is regular when $p$ is linear.
($\Rightarrow$)

proving the contrapositive: if $\deg(p) \geq 2$, then $L_p$ is not regular.

**Assumption:** Suppose $\deg(p) \geq 2$, and assume for contradiction that $L_p$ is regular.

Since $L_p$ is regular, there exists a pumping length $m$ such that every string $w \in L_p$ with $|w| \geq m$ can be written as $w = xyz$ where:
1. $|xy| \leq m$
2. $|y| \geq 1$
3. $xy^kz \in L_p$ for all $k \geq 0$


Let $p(n) = a_d n^d + a_{d-1} n^{d-1} + \cdots + a_1 n + a_0$ where $d \geq 2$ and $a_d > 0$.

The difference between consecutive values is:
$$p(n+1) - p(n) = a_d[(n+1)^d - n^d] + \text{lower degree terms}$$

Using the binomial theorem:
$$(n+1)^d = n^d + dn^{d-1} + O(n^{d-2})$$

Therefore:
$$p(n+1) - p(n) = a_d \cdot d \cdot n^{d-1} + O(n^{d-2})$$

For large $n$, this difference grows like $n^{d-1}$, which is unbounded since $d \geq 2$ implies $d-1 \geq 1$.


Choose $n_0$ large enough so that:
* $p(n_0) > m$ (so we can apply the pumping lemma)
* $p(n_0 + 1) - p(n_0) > 2m$ (this is possible since differences grow without bound)

Let $w = a^{p(n_0)} \in L_p$.

By the pumping lemma, we can write $w = xyz$ where:
* $|xy| \leq m$
* $|y| = \ell$ for some $1 \leq \ell \leq m$
* $xy^kz \in L_p$ for all $k \geq 0$

This means:
* $|w| = |xyz| = p(n_0)$
* $|xy^0z| = p(n_0) - \ell$
* $|xy^2z| = p(n_0) + \ell$
* In general, $|xy^kz| = p(n_0) + (k-1)\ell$


Since $xy^kz \in L_p$ for all $k \geq 0$, each length $p(n_0) + (k-1)\ell$ must equal $p(n_k)$ for some $n_k \in \mathbb{N}$.

This means the values:
$$p(n_0) - \ell, p(n_0), p(n_0) + \ell, p(n_0) + 2\ell, p(n_0) + 3\ell, \ldots$$

are all in the range of $p$.

Consider the arithmetic progression starting from $p(n_0)$ with common difference $\ell$. For this to be contained in $\{p(n) : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, we need:

For any large value $p(n_0) + j\ell = p(m)$ (for some large $m$), the next value in the arithmetic progression is:
$$p(n_0) + (j+1)\ell = p(n_0) + j\ell + \ell = p(m) + \ell$$

If this equals $p(m')$ for some $m' \in \mathbb{N}$, then:
$$p(m') - p(m) = \ell$$

However, for sufficiently large $m$, we have:
$$p(m+1) - p(m) > 2m > \ell$$

This means the gap between consecutive polynomial values eventually exceeds $\ell$. Therefore, we cannot find consecutive indices $m, m'$ in the arithmetic progression $p(n_0), p(n_0) + \ell, p(n_0) + 2\ell, \ldots$ such that both are polynomial values and their difference is exactly $\ell$ when both are sufficiently large.

More precisely: Since $p(n+1) - p(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, for any fixed $\ell$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n > N$:
$$p(n+1) - p(n) > \ell$$

This means that beyond $p(N)$, consecutive polynomial values are separated by more than $\ell$, so the arithmetic progression with difference $\ell$ cannot continue to hit polynomial values.
