Given a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta)$, where:

$Q$ is a finite set of states ($|Q| = n$).

$\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet.

$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is the transition function.

The Naive Algorithm (Subset Construction)

define a new directed graph (automaton) $\mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{S}, \Sigma, \Delta)$ where:

States ($\mathcal{S}$): The states of $\mathcal{P}$ are the non-empty subsets of $Q$. That is, $\mathcal{S} = 2^Q \setminus \{\emptyset\}$.

Transitions ($\Delta$): For any subset $S \subseteq Q$ and input symbol $a \in \Sigma$, the transition is defined as the set of all states reachable from $S$ upon reading $a$:


$$\Delta(S, a) = \{ \delta(q, a) \mid q \in S \}$$

Initialization: Start at the state representing the full set of original states: $S_{start} = Q$.

Search (BFS): Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the Power Automaton $\mathcal{P}$ starting from $S_{start}$.

Transitions: For the current subset $S$, generate the next subset for every input symbol $a \in \Sigma$.


$$S_{next} = \bigcup_{q \in S} \{\delta(q, a)\}$$

Termination Condition (Success): If the search reaches a state $S$ such that $|S| = 1$ (a singleton set), then a synchronizing word exists. The path from $Q$ to this singleton $\{q^*\}$ corresponds to the synchronizing word $w$.

Termination Condition (Failure): If the search exhausts all reachable subsets without finding a singleton, then no synchronizing word exists.
