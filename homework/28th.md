$$
\bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p = \{w : \#_a(w) = \#_b(w)\}
$$

Proof

Let $S = \{w : \#_a(w) = \#_b(w)\}$ denote the set of words with equal numbers of $a$'s and $b$'s. We prove both inclusions.

$S \subseteq \bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p$

Let $w \in S$. Then $\#_a(w) = \#_b(w)$, which means $\#_a(w) - \#_b(w) = 0$. 

Since $0 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ for every prime $p$, we have $w \in L_p$ for every prime $p$. 

Therefore:
$$
w \in \bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p
$$

$\bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p \subseteq S$

Let $w \in \bigcap_{p \text{ prime}} L_p$. Define $d = \#_a(w) - \#_b(w)$. 

Since $w \in L_p$ for every prime $p$, we have $d \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ for every prime $p$. This means every prime $p$ divides $d$.

Claim: $d = 0$.

Suppose for contradiction that $d \neq 0$. Then $|d| \geq 1$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $|d|$ has a prime factorization:

$$
|d| = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

where each $p_i$ is prime and each $a_i > 0$. Since there are infinitely many primes, there exists a prime $q$ such that $q \notin \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\}$. 

Then $q \nmid d$, contradicting the fact that every prime divides $d$. Therefore, we must have $d = 0$.

Since $d = \#_a(w) - \#_b(w) = 0$, we have $\#_a(w) = \#_b(w)$, so $w \in S$.
