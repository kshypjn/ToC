A context-free grammar (CFG) is linear if every production is of the form 
$$
A \to uBv \quad \text{or} \quad A \to w
$$
where $A, B$ are non-terminals and $u, v, w$ are (possibly empty) strings of terminals (with at most one non-terminal on the right-hand side).

Let $L = \{ w \mid w \text{ is a well-balanced string of parentheses over } \{(,)\} \}$.

Claim: $L$ cannot be generated by any linear grammar.

### Proof (by contradiction)

Assume, for contradiction, that there is a linear grammar $G$ such that $L(G) = L$.

A grammar is *linear* if every production is of the form
$$
A \to uBv \quad \text{or} \quad A \to w
$$
where $A,B$ are non-terminals and $u,v,w$ are strings of terminals (possibly empty). In particular, there is **at most one non-terminal** on the right-hand side of any production.

We will derive a contradiction using the fact that linear languages (in fact, all context-free languages) are closed under intersection with regular languages.

Define the regular language

$$
R = \{ (^{i})^{j}(^{k})^{\ell} \mid i,j,k,\ell \ge 0 \},
$$
the set of all strings that consist of: some number of ``(''s, then some number of ``)''s, then again some number of ``(''s, then some number of ``)''s.

Now consider the language
$$
L' = L \cap R.
$$

Because $L$ is context-free and $R$ is regular, $L'$ is context-free. Moreover, if $L$ were linear, then $L'$ would also be linear (linear languages are closed under intersection with regular languages).

We now describe $L'$ more explicitly. Take any string in $L'$; it is both:

- a well-balanced string of parentheses (so it belongs to $L$), and
- of the special ``four-block'' form from $R$: first only ``('', then only ``)'', then only ``('', then only ``)''.

For such a string to be well-balanced, the first block of ``('' must be matched exactly by the following block of ``)'', and the third block of ``('' must be matched exactly by the final block of ``)''. Hence every string in $L'$ has the form
$$
(^{n})^{n}(^{m})^{m} \quad \text{for some } n,m \ge 0.
$$
Therefore
$$
L' = \{ (^{n})^{n}(^{m})^{m} \mid n,m \ge 0 \}.
$$

Intuitively, this language requires the grammar to enforce **two independent equalities** at the same time:

- the number of ``('' in the first block must equal the number of ``)'' in the second block, and
- the number of ``('' in the third block must equal the number of ``)'' in the fourth block.

However, in a linear grammar, there is at most one non-terminal in each sentential form, so it can only ``count'' or enforce one such dependency at a time. Using the pumping lemma (or other standard arguments) for linear languages, one can show that
$$
\{ (^{n})^{n}(^{m})^{m} \mid n,m \ge 0 \}
$$
is **not** linear, because any pumping would eventually break one of the equalities $n=n$ or $m=m$.

Thus $L'$ is not a linear language. But if $L(G) = L$ were linear, then $L' = L \cap R$ would also have to be linear, which is a contradiction.

Hence our assumption was false. Therefore, there is no linear grammar that generates $L$, the language of well-balanced parentheses.
