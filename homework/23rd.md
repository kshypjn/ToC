Multiple Accepting States to Single Accepting State

Let M be a NFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where $F$ contains multiple accepting states.

To construct a new NFA $M' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0, \{q_f\})$ where $q_f$ is the only accepting state, and $M'$ accepts the same language as $M$.

Construction Steps

**1:** Start with the original NFA $M$ that has multiple accepting states $F = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_k\}$ where $k \geq 2$.

**2:** Create a new state $q_f$ that will be our single accepting state.

**3:** Define the new state set:
$$Q' = Q \cup \{q_f\}$$

adding one new state to all the old states.

**4:** the new transition function $\delta'$:
- For all states $q \in Q$ and all symbols $a \in \Sigma$:
  $$\delta'(q, a) = \delta(q, a)$$
  (keep all original transitions)
  
- For all old accepting states $f \in F$:
  $$\delta'(f, \varepsilon) = \{q_f\}$$
  This means from every old accepting state, we add an epsilon transition to the new single accepting state.
  
- For the new accepting state $q_f$:
  $$\delta'(q_f, a) = \emptyset \text{ for all } a \in \Sigma$$
  The new accepting state has no outgoing transitions.

**Step 5:** The new accepting state set is:
$$F' = \{q_f\}$$

Example

**Original NFA $M$:**
```
States: {q₀, q₁, q₂}
Alphabet: {0, 1}
Start state: q₀
Accept states: F = {q₁, q₂}

Transitions:
δ(q₀, 0) = {q₁}
δ(q₀, 1) = {q₂}
δ(q₁, 1) = {q₁}
δ(q₂, 0) = {q₂}
```

**Transformed NFA $M'$:**
```
States: {q₀, q₁, q₂, qf}
Alphabet: {0, 1}
Start state: q₀
Accept states: F' = {qf}

Transitions:
δ'(q₀, 0) = {q₁}
δ'(q₀, 1) = {q₂}
δ'(q₁, 1) = {q₁}
δ'(q₂, 0) = {q₂}
δ'(q₁, ε) = {qf}  ← NEW
δ'(q₂, ε) = {qf}  ← NEW
```

Multiple Initial States to Single Initial State

say there is an NFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, S, F)$ where $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\}$ is a set of initial states ($k \geq 2$).

Construction Steps

**1:** Start with the NFA $M$ that has multiple initial states $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\}$.

**2:** Create a new state $q_0'$ that will be our single initial state.

**3:** Define the new state set:
$$Q' = Q \cup \{q_0'\}$$

We're adding one new state to all the old states.

**4:** Define the new transition function $\delta'$:
- For all states $q \in Q$ and all symbols $a \in \Sigma$:
  $$\delta'(q, a) = \delta(q, a)$$
  (keep all original transitions)
  
- For the new initial state $q_0'$:
  $$\delta'(q_0', \varepsilon) = S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\}$$
  This means from the new start state, we can immediately jump to any of the old start states without reading any input.
  
- For the new initial state with other symbols:
  $$\delta'(q_0', a) = \emptyset \text{ for all } a \in \Sigma$$
  The new initial state only has $\varepsilon$-transitions, no regular transitions.

**5:** The new initial state is:
$$q_0' \text{ (single state)}$$

**6:** The accepting states remain the same:
$$F' = F$$

Example

**$M$ with multiple start states:**
```
States: {s₁, s₂, q₃}
Alphabet: {a, b}
Initial states: S = {s₁, s₂}
Accept states: F = {q₃}

Transitions:
δ(s₁, a) = {q₃}
δ(s₂, b) = {q₃}
```

This NFA accepts strings "a" (starting from $s_1$) and "b" (starting from $s_2$).

**Transformed NFA $M'$:**
```
States: {q₀', s₁, s₂, q₃}
Alphabet: {a, b}
Initial state: q₀'
Accept states: F' = {q₃}

Transitions:
δ'(q₀', ε) = {s₁, s₂}  ← NEW
δ'(s₁, a) = {q₃}
δ'(s₂, b) = {q₃}
```

Now $M'$ has a single start state $q_0'$, and it accepts the same language $\{a, b\}$.
