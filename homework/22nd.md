## Language Definition

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define:

$$L_n = \{w \in \{0,1\} : \text{the } n\text{th symbol from the end of } w \text{ is } 1\}$$

For example, $L_2$ accepts all strings where the 2nd to last bit is 1, like $10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, \ldots$

Upper Bound: NFA with $n+1$ States

**Construction:** We build an NFA with states $q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n$ where:
- Start state: $q_0$
- Accept state: $q_n$
- Transitions:
  - $\delta(q_0, 0) = \{q_0\}$ and $\delta(q_0, 1) = \{q_0, q_1\}$
  - $\delta(q_i, 0) = \delta(q_i, 1) = \{q_{i+1}\}$ for $1 \leq i < n$

The NFA guesses when it sees the 1 that is $n$ positions from the end. When it reads a 1, it non-deterministically moves to $q_1$ and counts exactly $n-1$ more symbols. If the guess was correct, it reaches $q_n$ exactly at the end of the string.

This NFA has $n+1$ states.
