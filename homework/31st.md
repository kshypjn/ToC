Let the alphabet be $\Sigma = \{a, b, c\}$.
We define the language $L = L_1 \cup L_2$, where:
1.  $L_1 = \{ a b^n c^n \mid n \ge 0 \}$
2.  $L_2 = \{ a^k w \mid k \ge 2, w \in \Sigma^* \}$ (All strings starting with $aa$)

L is Not Regular :
**Proof:**
1.  Assume, for contradiction, that $L$ is a regular language.
2.  Let $R$ be the regular language defined by the regular expression $a b^* c^*$. 
3.  The intersection of two regular languages must be regular.  $L \cap R$:
    * Strings in $L_2$ start with $aa$. Since strings in $R$ start with a single $a$ ; $L_2 \cap R = \emptyset$.
    * Strings in $L_1$ are of the form $a b^n c^n$. These perfectly match the pattern of $R$.
    * Therefore, $L \cap R = \{ a b^n c^n \mid n \ge 0 \}$.
4.  Let $L' = L \cap R = \{ a b^n c^n \mid n \ge 0 \}$.
5.  If $L$ were regular, $L'$ would also be regular.
6.  However, applying a homomorphism $h$ such that $h(L') = \{ b^n c^n \mid n \ge 0 \}$.
7.  Since $L'$ reduces to a non-regular language, $L'$ is not regular.
8.  This contradicts the assumption that $L$ is regular.

L Satisfies the Pumping Lemma

Pumping Lemma states that there exists a constant $p$ such that any string $w \in L$ with $|w| \ge p$ can be decomposed into $w = xyz$ satisfying:
1.  $|xy| \le p$
2.  $|y| \ge 1$
3.  $xy^k z \in L$ for all $k \ge 0$

Let the pumping constant **$p = 2$**.
Consider any string $w \in L$ with length $|w| \ge 2$.

Case 1: $w$ is in $L_2$ (starts with $aa$)
* Decomposition: Let $x = \epsilon$, $y = a$ , $z = \text{rest of string}$.
* Validity: Since $w$ starts with $aa$, $z$ starts with $a$.
* Pumping:
    * For any $k \ge 1$, the string starts with $aa$ or more $a$'s. It remains in $L_2$.

Case 2: $w$ is in $L_1$ - starts with $a b^n c^n$
* Decomposition: Let $x = \epsilon$, $y = a$ (the first letter), $z = b^n c^n$.
* Conditions: $|xy| = 1 \le p$ and $|y| = 1 \ge 1$.
* Pumping ($xy^k z$):
    * If $k = 1$: We get $a b^n c^n$. This is the original string, which is in **$L_1$**.
    * If $k \ge 2$: We generate $a^k b^n c^n$. This string starts with $a^k$ where $k \ge 2$
