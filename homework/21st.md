DFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ accepts an infinite language if and only if its transition graph contains a directed cycle that is reachable from $q_0$ and from which an accepting state in $F$ is reachable.

## Proof

### $(\Rightarrow)$ If $L(M)$ is infinite then a valid cycle exists.

Assume $L(M)$ is infinite. Since $\Sigma$ is finite, $L(M)$ must contain strings of arbitrary length. There exists a string $w \in L(M)$ such that $|w| \ge |Q|$.

Let $n = |Q|$. Let $w = a_1 a_2 \dots a_m$ where $m \ge n$.
Consider the sequence of states visited by $M$ while processing $w$:
$$r_0, r_1, r_2, \dots, r_m$$

where $r_0 = q_0$ and $r_{i+1} = \delta(r_i, a_{i+1})$.

The sequence contains $m+1$ states. Since $m \ge n$, the length of the sequence is at least $n+1$. By pigeonhole, since there are only $n$ distinct states in $Q$, some state must repeat in the sequence.

Let $r_i$ and $r_j$ be occurrences of the same state such that $0 \le i < j \le m$ and $r_i = r_j$. Let this state be $q_{cycle}$.

1.  **Reachable:** The path from $r_0$ to $r_i$ corresponds to the prefix $a_1 \dots a_i$. Thus, $q_{cycle}$ is reachable from $q_0$.
2.  **Cycle:** The path from $r_i$ to $r_j$ corresponds to the substring $a_{i+1} \dots a_j$. Since $i < j$, this path has length $\ge 1$ and forms a loop from $q_{cycle}$ to itself.
3.  **Co-reachable:** Since $w \in L(M)$, the final state $r_m \in F$. The path from $r_j$ to $r_m$ corresponds to the suffix $a_{j+1} \dots a_m$. Thus, an accepting state is reachable from $q_{cycle}$.


###  $(\Leftarrow)$ If a valid cycle exists then $L(M)$ is infinite.

Assume the transition graph of $M$ contains a cycle that is reachable from $q_0$ and co-reachable to some $q_f \in F$.

Let $q_{cycle}$ be a state on this cycle. The path can be decomposed into 3 parts
1.  String $u$: path from $q_0$ to $q_{cycle}$.
2.  String $v$: path around the cycle from $q_{cycle}$ to $q_{cycle}$ ($|v| \ge 1$).
3.  String $w$: path from $q_{cycle}$ to $q_f \in F$.

Hence,
$$\delta^*(q_0, u) = q_{cycle}$$
$$\delta^*(q_{cycle}, v) = q_{cycle}$$
$$\delta^*(q_{cycle}, w) = q_f$$

Consider the set of words $S = \{ u v^k w \mid k \ge 0 \}$.
For any integer $k \ge 0$, the machine processes $u$ to reach $q_{cycle}$, loops $v$ exactly $k$ times to return to $q_{cycle}$, and processes $w$ to reach $q_f$.
$$\delta^*(q_0, u v^k w) = q_f \in F$$

Since $|v| \ge 1$, $|u v^k w| = |u| + k|v| + |w|$ is strictly increasing with $k$. Therefore, $S$ contains infinitely many distinct strings, all of which are accepted by $M$.

Hence proved.
